This is a partial list of giant pandas, both alive and deceased. The giant panda is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.[1] Wild population estimates of the bear vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,[2] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[3]
